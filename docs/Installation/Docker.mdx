## Steps for installation of Apache Airflow using Docker

Create a directory where you want to put airflow docker files along with dags. You can keep them in different directory but for this demo I will keep them in same directory 
Create app directory for superset and dependencies

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /app/airflow/docker
sudo chown -R user:user /app
```

now lets download the docker compose file with wget you can specify the version i am currently using latest i.e. `2.10.4`

```bash
wget https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.10.4/docker-compose.yaml 
```


Couple of things i would recommend to update in docker-compose.yml file are
    1. Change postgres version 13 to 16
    



create directories
```bash
mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins ./config
```

Docker user needs a consistent user id for avoiding the permission issue hence we are create .env with userid of current user
```bash
echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" > .env

```

Optionally you can edit default username password with following command

```bash
echo -e "_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_USERNAME=admin" >> .env
echo -e "_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD=admin" >> .env
```

       
you can also set `AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES` to `'false'`


To initialize everything
```bash
docker compose up airflow-init
```

To run airflow
```bash
docker compose up
```

With these steps, your Apache Airflow should now be running as docker. You can access the Airflow UI by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.
